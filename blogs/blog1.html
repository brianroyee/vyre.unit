                <p>Yesterday, the internet stood still - and not because of a new Elon tweet. This was something far more... vintage. <i>The infamous imageboard 4chan, often hailed as the birthplace of modern internet chaos, was hacked in spectacular fashion.</i> 
                    <br>And the culprits? A rogue gang of ex-4chan dwellers from an equally chaotic corner of the web called <i><b>Soyjack.party</b></i>, or “Sharty” for short.
                    <br>This wasn’t just a case of <i>“oops, the site is down.”</i></p>
                    
                    <p><i>It was a bloody full-scale breach</i></p>
                    
                    <h3>💥What Happened?</h3>
                    <p>The attackers exploited a long-standing vulnerability in 4chan’s backend, accessing private staff forums, internal emails, IP logs of janitors (low-level moderators), and even banned user databases. But how did they get in?<br>
                        🔒No phishing.<br>
                        🔒No password reuse.<br>
                        🔒No social engineering.<br>
                        <i>They simply exploited insecure legacy code — the kind that should’ve been <u>updated years ago</u>.</i></p>

                    <p>Let’s get technical for a moment:<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;📍 4chan’s backend is built in PHP (yes, still).<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;📍 Some boards allow PDF uploads, but the site doesn’t verify the file type properly.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;📍 The attackers uploaded a PostScript file, which got passed to an image processor called Ghostscript to generate a thumbnail.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Problem‼️:</b> 4chan was using <i>Ghostscript</i> from 2012, riddled with vulnerabilities.<br>
                        Using known exploits listed in the CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) database, the hackers gained access to elevated privileges.<br>
                        And that was that. Full access, admin-level control, and a digital walk through 4chan’s janitorial closet.</p>

                    <h3>🧢 Who Are These Hackers?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The attackers are not random trolls. They’re the exiles of 4chan’s old QA board, a section originally meant for questions and answers that descended into meme warfare, janitor-bashing, and relentless moderation debates.
                        In 2021, QA was removed for being too chaotic. But its spirit lived on in Soyjack.party, which now made a triumphant (albeit hostile) return by hacking back into their old stomping grounds.
                    </p>

                    <h3>📊Better Future: Modern Databases</h3>
                    <p>
                        If 4chan’s outdated MySQL setup gives you hives, here’s some hope. Modern applications are shifting to high-performance databases like Timescale, an open-source solution built on PostgreSQL. It’s optimized for real-time analytics, time-series data, and low-latency queries — perfect for scale-hungry applications.
                        With automatic partitioning and a hybrid row-column engine, Timescale is a lesson in what could have been if 4chan had stayed modern.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>This hack wasn’t just about 4chan. It was a cautionary tale for anyone running legacy infrastructure. Ignoring updates, running decade-old OS versions, and skipping file type validation?<br>That’s an open invitation to the internet’s wildest actors.<br>
                        As meme wars rage on in digital shadows, one truth remains: <i>Patch your stuff.</i></b></p>
